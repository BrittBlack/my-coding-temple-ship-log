A. Basics of Variables:
    a. What is a variable in Python?
      A variable is a container for storing data values.
    b. How is memory allocation for a variable done?

        Memory allocation can be defined as allocating a block of space in the computer memory to a program. In Python memory allocation and deallocation method is automatic as the Python developers created a garbage collector for Python so that the user does not have to do manual garbage collection.

B. Variable Assignment:
    a. Explore how to assign values to variables.
    Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line.

    b. Can a variable hold multiple values?
    Make sure the number of variables matches the number of values, or else you will get an error.

C. Variable Naming Convention:
    a. Research the rules and conventions for naming variables.

                A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
    A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
    A variable name cannot start with a number
    A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
    Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
    A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

    b. Identify a list of reserved keywords that can't be used as variable names.


    Python has a set of keywords that are reserved words that cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers:

    Keyword	Description
    and	       A logical operator
    as	          To create an alias
    assert	    For debugging
    break	    To break out of a loop
    class	    To define a class
    continue	To continue to the next iteration of a loop
    def	    To define a function
    del	    To delete an object
    elif	Used in conditional statements, same as else if
    else	Used in conditional statements
    except	Used with exceptions, what to do when an exception occurs
    False	Boolean value, result of comparison operations
    finally	Used with exceptions, a block of code that will be executed no matter if there is an exception or not

    for	    To create a for loop
    from	To import specific parts of a module
    global	To declare a global variable
    if	    To make a conditional statement
    import	To import a module
    in	    To check if a value is present in a list, tuple, etc.
    is	     To test if two variables are equal
    lambda	    To create an anonymous function
    None	    Represents a null value
    nonlocal	To declare a non-local variable
    not	    A logical operator
    or	    A logical operator
    pass	A null statement, a statement that will do nothing
    raise	To raise an exception
    return	To exit a function and return a value
    True	Boolean value, result of comparison operations
    try	    To make a try...except statement
    while	To create a while loop
    with	Used to simplify exception handling
    yield	To return a list of values from a generator
